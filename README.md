# Collections Practice

### Skills: iteration, arrays, dictionaries

## Instructions

The goal of this lab is to become proficient manipulating the basic data structures we use in iOS, arrays and dictionaries.  Try experimenting with the built in iOS NSArray and NSDictionary methods as well as implementing your own logic to solve these.  Write methods that solve each of the unit tests.

**Write your methods in the `collections.h/.m`**
